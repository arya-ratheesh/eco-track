### Project Description
[Eco-Track is a web-based activity logger designed to help individuals monitor and reduce their daily environmental footprint. By logging sustainable habits—such as using reusable—users receive real-time feedback through an impact meter that gamifies the journey toward a greener lifestyle]

### The Problem statement
[Many people want to live more sustainably but struggle to stay motivated because their individual actions feel invisible or insignificant. Without a clear way to track daily progress or visualize their positive impact, eco-conscious habits often fail to stick, leading to "climate fatigue]

### The Solution
[actionable advice and prompts them to save useful sustainability insights for future referenceEco-Track provides a gamified, all-in-one platform that transforms individual environmental actions into tangible progress. The app solves the problem of "invisible impact" through three core features:

Dynamic Scoring & Feedback: A real-time impact meter and status system (e.g., "Eco-Beginner") provide immediate positive reinforcement for every logged habit.

Daily Challenges & Streaks: A streak-tracking system encourages daily engagement, turning sustainable living into a rewarding long-term habit.

Educational Integration: A "Tip of the Day" feature provides users with]

## Project Documentation

#### Screenshots (Add at least 3)

![Screenshot1](Add screenshot 1 here with proper name)
this screenshot displays the 'Eco-Track' interface at the start of a user's journey. It features a progress tracker, a daily streak counter (currently at 0), and an input field where users can log sustainable habits to calculate their environmental impact score.*<img width="498" height="861" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-14 081558" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54277bee-da30-4262-83f3-0bb1d893255c" />



![Screenshot2](Add screenshot 2 here with proper name)
This screenshot demonstrates the core functionality of the Eco-Track application after a user logs an activity. Key updates from the initial state include:

Activity Logging: The user has entered the phrase "i used a recycled bag today" into the input field.

Active Daily Challenge: The loading state has been replaced by a specific challenge: "Walk or bike for a short trip instead of driving."

Streak Milestone: The streak counter has updated from 0 to 1 day, reflecting the user's first recorded activity.

Score Calculation: The impact score has moved from 0 to 100, and the progress bar has filled completely to represent this achievement.

nges their entry from "i used a recycled bag today" to "i used a plastic bag today," the score drops from 100 to 80.

Streak Penalty: Along with the lower score, the user's streak resets from 1 day back down to 0 days, indicating that using a plastic bag does not count as a "green" action toward a daily streak.

Progress Bar Feedback: The visual progress bar, which was completely filled at a score of 100, retracts to a partial state to reflect the 20-point loss.

ive, etc.]
The demonstration video provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the Eco-Track application, showcasing how a user interacts with the platform from start to finish
Key Features Demonstrated:

Real-time Habit Logging: Shows the user entering a sustainable action (e.g., "I used a recycled bag today") and clicking the "Calculate My Score" button.

Dynamic UI Updates: Highlights the instant movement of the "Impact Level" progress bar and the change in numerical score based on the input.

Gamification Elements: Displays the active "Streak Counter" 

Educational Engagement: Demonstrates the "Daily Challenge" prompt and the "Tip of the Day" interaction, including the "Save Tip" functionality.

User Flow:

Onboarding: The user opens the app and sees the current "Daily Challenge."

Activity: The user logs their eco-friendly activity for the day.

Feedback: The system processes the entry, updates the score.

Retention: The user sees their streak increase, encouraging them to return the next day.

Technical Highlights:

Responsive Web Design: Smooth transitions and a clean, "green-themed" interface that adapts to user input.

State Management: Efficient JavaScript logic that handles calculations .

Instant Validation: Demonstrates how the app handles inputs to ensure users are rewarded accurately for their sustainable habits.

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
-Feature Brainstorming and Conceptualization: Assisted in defining the "Eco-Score" logic and gamification elements like streaks and status levels.
Technical Debugging & Problem Solving

**Key Prompts Used:**
- Help me debug the 'remote origin already exists' and 'fetch first' errors in the Git terminal
**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [75%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- refinement and polish

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
